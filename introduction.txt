Hi! My name is Glen Jace, and I’m a passionate learner, creator, and aspiring entrepreneur from Kenya.
I'm currently immersed in the ALX pathway, where I’ve been building skills in software engineering, entrepreneurship, business finance, and venture creation.
I’m driven by a mission to solve real-world problems using technology, especially in the areas of education, investing, and youth empowerment across Africa.
I’ve founded projects like Young Investors, a gamified micro-investing platform, and Jace Studio, a digital solutions agency helping small businesses grow through branding, content, and digital tools.
I'm deeply interested in how technology, storytelling, and community can merge to create powerful impact. 
I'm currently exploring AI, no-code development, and market research, while also preparing for my U.S. college applications.
